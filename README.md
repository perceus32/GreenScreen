# GreenScreen
Displaying custom background in a video with green screen using OpenCV 

There are two python files. 
main.py can change the green screen in the background with any custom image. Just a generic masking script.

prank.py was an attempt to merge the pics of two of my friends by using one range of hsv from one pic and other range of hsv from other. It is not currently proper and 
requires changes :(
